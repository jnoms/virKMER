                          for in the READS_FILE.
        -o <OUTPUT_FILE>  Path to the output fastq containing only reads that
                          have one or more kmers.

# kmer_file (-f) and report back the line before it (the header). Get only the
# headers by grepping for '@'. Because there are also line numbers, cut those
# out. Use set to remove the "@" from the start of each line.
